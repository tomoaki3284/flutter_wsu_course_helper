This kinematic description of motion is then connected to a dynamic description through Newton�s laws and the forces causing the motion. Conservation laws, energy, momentum, collisions, and rotational motion are also considered. Material is explored using a student-centered, inquiry approach melding laboratory and more traditional approaches. Three longer activities emphasizing experimental design and data collection are undertaken across the semester in addition to the daily explorations. Mathematical prerequisites are high school algebra and trigonometry. The concepts of slope and area under the curve are used throughout the course, but formal calculus is not required. Three two-hour meetings per week.",

The goal of this course is to explore the phenomena of the school to prison pipeline. Where are the stops along this pipeline? What does its existence reveal to us about race and poverty in the United States? Exploration of educational policy, the prison industrial complex and the history of structural inequality are central to the course. Students will be able to articulate definitions and perform analysis of this system and address historical conditions which created it along with strategies for dismantling the pipeline.",

It focuses on the geo-systems of the Earth, including the four major 'spheres': Atmosphere (weather, climatology); Lithosphere (landforms); Hydrosphere (water resources); and Biosphere (flora, fauna). The human-environmental interaction is emphasized. Laboratory and field experiments will explore the various spheres of the Earth and include map interpretation, remote sensing analysis, atmospheric studies, geomorphology investigation, and other human-environment interactions.",

These perspectives have been used by social analysts and sociologists since the 19th century to the present in their analysis and understanding of society and human behavior. More specifically, students focus on the ideas and themes about society and eminent social analysts like Auguste Comte, Herbert Spencer, Karl Marx, George Simmel, Talcott Parsons and others. Of importance is for the students to begin gaining an understanding of how the ideas of these social analysts are of relevance to modern society as well as their own experiences.",
